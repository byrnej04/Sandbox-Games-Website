        <h2>What are Sandbox Games?</h2>
        <p> 
            Sandbox games are a unique genre of video games, characterised by open-world exploration, freedom and interactive content. This is in contrast to more traditional linear games with pre-set narratives and defined objects, sandbox games allow players to have the freedom to explore virtual worlds where they have the autonomy to shape their own experiences. The term "sandbox" is metaphorical, it refers to the idea of a child's play area where creativity and imagination run free. In the context of video games, this metaphor refers to the freedom players have to manipulate and influence the game.

        <h2>Key Features of Sandbox Games</h2>
        <p>
           One defining feature of sandbox games is the open world, a vast and seamless virtual space that players can roam freely. This openness enables players to choose their own paths and objectives. This freedom of choice is a key feature of the sandbox experience, allowing players to decide how they approach challenges, interact with characters, and pursue goals. Whether constructing elaborate structures, embarking on quests, or engaging in gameplay, players enjoy a level of interactivity rarely found in more structured game genres.
        </p>
        <p>
           Interactivity is another key element of sandbox games. These games go beyond predetermined paths by allowing players to interact with elements in the world in meaningful ways. Whether it's shaping the terrain, manipulating objects, or influencing the outcome of in-game events, the interactive nature of sandbox games creates a sense of immersion and creativity. This interaction often leads to emergent gameplay, where unexpected outcomes arise from player decisions.
